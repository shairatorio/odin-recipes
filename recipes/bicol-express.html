    <h2>Bicol Express Recipe</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Bicol Express</em></strong> is a must-try, especially if you haven’t! People actually think this dish originated from Bicol, 
        considering its name and the association of Bicolanos to spicy food, but it’s really not. 
        <strong><em>Bicol Express</em></strong> was said to came about because a restaurant owner in Manila cooked a dish with a 
        more tolerable spice level and did not know what to name it until a train that was headed to Bicol passed by; 
        hence the name <strong><em>Bicol Express</em></strong>!</p>
    <p>That said, <strong><em>Bicol Express</em></strong> was actually originally made so more people could enjoy a spiced-up 
        dish—and we are sure enjoying it now as much as we can. As spicy lovers, we are not going to 
        deny the fact that we really don’t hold back on the chilis when it comes to our Bicol Express. Well, 
        unless we have someone in company that has a low tolerance on spice, then of course, we’ll watch our chilis.</p>
    <p>Anyway, with all that out there, if you are like us and you enjoy a good spicy, milky, and coconutty 
        dish, then our <strong><em>Bicol Express</em></strong> is perfect for you too! The subtle sweetness of coconut milk sure brings a 
        delectable twist to the rather sharp tones and richness of chilis and bagoong, also known as shrimp paste, 
        so you better be ready for a wonderful and tasty feast of flavors when you follow our recipe!</p>
