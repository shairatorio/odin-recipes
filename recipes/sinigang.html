    <h2>Sinigang Recipe</h2>
    <p><strong><em>Sinigang</em></strong> is a popular Filipino dish not only among Filipinos, but also with other 
        nationalities. At first, though, tourists get weirded out with its distinct yet delicious 
        flavor profile as Sinigang's trademark is actually its sour and savory tasting soup.</p>
    <p>Its sourness is often associated with tamarind, but surely, other fruits and leaves can also 
        be used as a souring agent such as kamias and calamansi. Indeed, <strong><em>Sinigang</em></strong> is a favorite 
        of many as it also goes well with steamed white rice. Besides that, this dish is actually 
        great for sharing too! Its soup can already be a viand, if you know what we mean. Every sip of 
        it bring so much warmth and comfort, especially on cold rainy nights or when you are missing home.</p>
